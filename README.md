# Welcome to the AI Crash Course!

In this course you will be learning about the 3 most popular areas of Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning, Deep Learning and even Reinforcement Learning!

We will take a glimpse at each area and we will learn many algorithms that can be applied to many different situations.
We won't dig too deep into the technical knowledge of how each algorithm works, but rather learn the basics, the philosophy and what accomplishes each algorithm.

In this GitHub, you will find all the files used for each demonstration except for the Course 08.

> For the demonstration in course 08, we used an existing **.ipynb** made by the Tensorflow team. It can be found in the following [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan).

# Presentations
